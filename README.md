# AsciiGenerator
The AsciiGenerator was one of the major projects from my class at MCA. We were tasked with taking an image and turn it into an Ascii image. * An acsii image is an image where the pixels consists of letters or symbols instead of colors.
The program is an form project that has the user upload a image and select a kernal size. The program will then convert the image into greyscale using kernals and then into the ascii version of the image.
